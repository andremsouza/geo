# Search and Mining of Large Volumes of Text in a Relational DBMS

This repository contains the source code of a scientific initiation project developed between September 2018 and September 2019, which culminated on my final undergraduate project in the first semester of 2020. The project comprises a structure for the storage of data of Brazilian Olympic athletes, with an emphasis on the efficient recovery of textual data and metadata for text mining.

## Abstract

This project explores retrieval and indexing techniques for full-text search, and metadata extraction and storage techniques for text mining purposes on interview transcripts stored in an object-relational DBMS. In particular, this project deals with transcripts of interviews with Brazilian Olympic Athletes, conducted by the Group of Olympic Studies of the University of São Paulo. An indexing, metadata management, and search solution were proposed to support text mining tasks, using advanced PostgreSQL features and an API, following a REST architecture, for access and search to the database by researchers. The implemented solution achieved high-performance gains, compared to traditional text search methods used by relational DBMSes, as well as an efficient way of accessing data, characterized by its expansibility, enabling future work.
